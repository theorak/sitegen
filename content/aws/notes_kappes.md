#### Questions and Examples:

TYPO3 on AWS
- [typo3 scalability](https://typo3.com/blog/typo3-on-aws-scalability-and-performance)
- [typo3 on aws](https://t3planet.de/en/blog/install-typo3-on-aws/)

## Benefits of the Cloud

- agility
- fixed/upfront expenses become variable expenses
- elastic, horizontal scalabilty
- pay by usage

## Instance Access Management (IAM)

- accounts stored globally (your whole AWS setup)
- to use IAM Identity Center is new best practice
**root user** - only owner (should create admin for permissions)
**user** - any admins, should use MFA, can be assigned roles, can be grouped
**roles** - only assumed for specific permissions/tasks, temporary
**format** - acount@account-group

#### IAM Policy

- JSON format document/ruleset
- allows and denies access to AWS services and resources

#### IAM Roles

- sets of IAM policies that result in roles
- can be account agnostic, but must choose one
- can be restricted to specific cloud services
- can be defaults or custom permissions
- ARN key as role ID
- saved internally as JSON configuration
- 'assume a role' is a required permission to hand it out

**Console user access** - User ID + password + MFA
**Programatic user access** - access key ID + secret access key, max 2 per user
**AWS Acceptable Use Policy** - Guidelines what is allowed within AWS usage

#### AWS Organizations

- contain multiple accounts and organizational units (these are NOT groups)
- can add organizational units (OU) to create IAM group hierachy
- consolidated billing AND
- service control policies (SCPs) for single account or OU, as umbrella definition of maximum permissions
- each comes with full access control policy, stacked with other deny policies

#### Identities and Providers

**Principal** - entity allowed or denied access, IAM user, IAM root user, IAM role, service, defined in policy doc
**Identity** - the principal's credentials, identifier, access key or password/username, verifier
**Federated Identity** - single-sign on (SSO), access for groups, additional access without logins
- can use SAML 2.0 or OpenID, add application
- create in IAM center, as federated user to gain SSO domain data
- add identity source connect personal information from AWS Managed Active Directory or Microsoft AD or other external providers (Google Workspace, Okta, Cyber Ark, ...)

#### AWS Managed Active Directory

**Directory Services** - store and mange access to resources, can be AWS Cloud, MS or other providors
- AD Connector is self-managed MS AD, allows to add Win user identities to instances
- simple AD is legacy tech (based on region)
- Windows Instance could use this (Domain join directory and IAM instance profile)
- multiple domain controller possible, for extra cost
- can be useed for RDP access

#### Control Tower

- setup multi-account environments
- automated account distribution
- distribute identities

#### Cognito

**User Pools** - add sign-ins and sign-up **Identities**
**Identity Pools** - distribute **Federated Identities**
**Cognito Sync** - cross device syncronization, also can use AppSynch
- authorization for web and mobile apps
- so either create AWS managed users or translate access credentials into AWS credentials

#### Policy Builder:

[policy builder](https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html)

## EC2 Instances

#### Browsing EC2 Instances

[instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
- instances in various sizes with unique keys (Kennungen)

#### Pricings

**On-Demand** - per instance hour, second accurate, pilots and poc
**Spot** - save price by using spare capacity, stateless workloads, can be interrupted
**Reserved** - specific workloads, by increasing price: Standard, Convertible, Scheduled, Third-Party
**Saving plan** - specific workloads and availability, can't be resold

#### Tenancy options

**Dedicated Instance** - instance reserved
**Dedicated Host** - hardware reserved, costs most
*=> pick price and payment options, based on availability
*=> only with running instance costs are tracked

#### Launching an Instance

- Name it, tag it
- Pick Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which OS to use
- instance type, fitted for your requirements and price
- key pair for login
- Network settings, for multiple instances and remote access
- Storage, as per your application requirements
- Details, adding domain, IAM profile for this instance, launch and restart, tenancy, launch scripts
- Save and Launch possible

#### Running Instance:

- can't change type
- change security options, access roles, clone, ...

#### AWS CloudFormation:

- stores templates for launching EC2 instances, VPC, S3 buckets
- Configurations templates in YAML/XHTML with instructions to build from
- see Architecture - Solutions Library for example templates

**Access Key Pairs** - see access key created for instances
**Network Interfaces** - see wich networks are connected for each instance, eni>subnet>VPC routing

#### Terraform

- not AWS exclusive, can deploy accross different Clouds

## Networking

#### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- **virtual networks**
- **subnet rules for VPC**
- Region > Availability Zone > VPC (cross-zones) > Private Subnet/s (IP addressable, assigned to AZ)
- can have NAT, CIDR (notation for subnet mask), identifying tag

#### Internet Gateway

- add to VPC
- allows internet access per VPC
- opening for traffic

#### Routing Table

- define Subnets with routing tables
- destination for traffic
- public IP-Addresses for Instances (can be elastic)
- so far IPV4 based, that cost
- adding both a IGW and subnet to the same table, makes that subnet public
- first 5 IPs are reserved for routing, gateway, DNS, broadcast, spare

#### NAT Gateway

- lies in public subnet
- allows to share internet access to private subnet
- should be reduncdant across AZs as well
- costs

#### Network settings of EC2 instance

- select VPC
- assign the instance to a subnet
- assign a security group (max 5)
- additional IPs possible

#### Security Group:

- **virtual firewall for EC2 instance**
- default deny inbound
- default allow outbound
- stateful package recognition

#### Network Firewall

- **virtual firewall as subnet** (its own)
- to chain before other subnets
- based on surica firewall rules
- stateful and stateless rules

#### Network Access Control List (network ACL)

- **virtual firewall for subnet** (attached)
- default ACL allows interaction with the subnet
- default allow all
- custom starts with deny all
- rules matched top to bottom
- stateless, no traffic recognition

#### Connection Options for EC2 instance:

- security groups should first open ports for used protocols
- **SSH connections** are available via generated key-pass
**Instance Connect** - IP-based service into instance console

#### Systems Manager 

- can **create sessions to SSM agent within the instance** (AWS-provided images)
- can group instances to give all the same commands
- that requires user permissions via IAM (SSMManagedInstanceCore)
- add this role to instance
- does not need additional SSH, port or Security Group rules
- interaction will be as ssm-user

## Storage Services

#### Storage Overview:

**Block Storage** - Elastic Block Storage (EBS), Instance Store - stores on networked or dedicated drives
**File Storage** - Elastic File System (EFS), FSx - stores across AZ, single region
**Object Storage** - Simple Storage Service (S3), S3 Glacier - stores in region, can clone across region

#### Elastic Block Store (EBS)

- **block storage**
- **networked distance drive**
- storage for instance
- equal-sized block of data
- will cost additionally
- root volumes terminate with instance, additional volumes don't
- volumes can be snapshotted, saved, restored, cloned
- single availabilty zone, same as the instance

#### Instance Store:

- **dedicated block storage**
- **physical drive close by**
- storage for instance
- usually SSDs for fastest operation
- only temporarely, deleted with instance shutdown, never stored

#### Elastic File System (EFS)

- **file storage system**
- shared access possible
- **scalabe file system (NFS v4)**
- can open linux mount points for your applications or EC instances
- multiple availabilty zones, for high redundancy
- storage classes: Standard, Infrequent Access, One-Zone (single AZ)
- offer ready for compliance laws

#### Amazon FSx:

- for non-Linux file systems
- **Windows File Server, Lustre, NetApp ONTAP, Open ZFS**

#### Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3):

- **object storage**
- **create buckets as needed**
- AWS controlls creation and management
- optimized for different data use cases
- bucket names must be unique, becomes part of domain
- can use **IAM roles/user or bucket access policies**
- allows versioning, tagging, encryption and external access
- keeps all files with their metadata
- object lock forces WORM (write once read many)

#### Bucket Access Policy:

- needs statements
- will enforce access via tokens
- could (not recommended anymore) host static websites

#### Bucket Access Lists and Access Points:

- grant access with sub path per IAM role/user

#### S3 storage classes:

**Standard** - frequently accessed, high redundancy
**Standard-IA** - infrequenly accessed, lower storage price, higher retrieval price
**One Zone-IA** - infrequenly accessed, store data in a single AZ, lower storage price
**Intelligent-Tiering** - monitored, adjusted on access behavior, automation fee cost
**Glacier Instant/Flexible/Deep Arcive** - access in milliseconds < minutes to hours < 12 hours for retrieval
	- fastest is most expensive, last being cheapest
	- Glacier interaction usually via SDK

#### S3 Pricing:

- based on **storage type, space and access fequency, object size**
- more space, deeper storage, higher price
- less frequency, lower price
- larger transfers, volume discount
- reading data costs, into other regions costs

#### S3-Multipart-Upload:

- uses multiple network connections to upload in parts
- speed-up
- can be paused

#### S3 Events:

- tagging, creation, deletion
- sends SQS messages to lambda functions
- eg. creating thumbnails, informing changes, event tracking

#### S3 Transfer Acceleration

- get edge locations for specific buckets
- for faster access to this bucket
- if you often have large transfers to this bucket

## EC2 Autoscaling and Elastic Load Balancing

#### Architecture Plan

- **target architecture**, your instances and storages should be scalable and elastic
- **n-tier web application architecture**
- architecture should split into **purpose built/configured servers**
	- eg: Browser <> Web Server <> Application Server <> Data Server
	- secured separatly as well
	- load balancer can then be established in multiples
	
**Example Solutions:** [solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/=
	
#### AWS Load Balancing

- **IP, instance and protocol health checkup**
- **all in single VPCs**
- accross subnets, access to instances
- tier for each web or app instances separatly
- security group for instances in same tier must allow load balancer
- network ACL already allows access to subnets
- can tage Certificates from ACM, IAM or imported personal (still needs Route 53 for domain name of that certificate)

#### Application LB

- **network layer 7, applications**
- IP, instance and lambta
- round-robin algorithm
- ports 800, 443

#### Network LB 

- **network layer 4, transport**
- IP, instance and ALB
- flow hash

#### Gateway LB 

- **Network layer 4 and 7**
- IP and instance
- proxy does not terminate
- routint table lookup

#### Classic Load Balancer

- **legacy load balancing service**
- for old applications of the EC2-classic network

#### Creating Load Balancer config

- choose type of **ALB, NLB, GLB**
- network, pick one VPC and AZs
- target group, instances and protocol to check, specific IPs or sub URL paths
- connection to other services
- creates subgroups automatically to start managing (results in public IPs that cost)

#### EC2 Autoscaling Group

- **configuration for instances**
- **adds more instance clones of instance**
- can set minimum, desired and maximum, as well as temporal plan
- no extra cost, as long as maximum is defined
- also provides redundancy, by replacing instances
- target tracking scaling, automtic change desired capacity by metric

#### Creating Autoscaling config

- **requires launch template**, containing descriptions for instance launch (can create from existing instance), at least Amazon Machine Instance
- **network settings that matches the instances**
- add script to show metadata, this helps to separate them
- launch options to control hardware extensions in line with reservation/billing plan
- network should select subnets from at least 2 zones
- set size minimum, desired, maximum

## Billing and Pricing

#### Cost Control

- creating estimates [calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/)
- services and instances, storage, transfer inbound, IPs, Monitoring, ... 
- IAM access to billing [iam access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started-account-iam.html)

**Cost Explorer - shows accumelated cost by date, and especially usage, forecasting
**Cost Explorer Reports - can save filters as report
**Bill - per account, shows cost per service usage as tree
**Cost allocation tag - management can create tags for users, to group cost
**Free Tier - overview of free contingents used
**Budgets
	- set budget limit and warnings
	- budget warnings can be set for thresholds
	- threshold warning can follow with action to shutdown instance or prevent IAM role from starting new

## Databases

- should be chosen on use case, **relational (more commmon)** vs **non-relational databases**
- SQL language also used most commonly
- should have main username and password

#### Managed Services vs Unmanaged Services

- AWS handels up to scaling, unmaged only up to OS install
- you handle only Application optimization, unmanaged down ot OS updates
- **either you install DBs in EC2 instances, or use a DB Service by AWS**

#### Amazon RDS

- selection of commonly used engines, version and license can be provided
- Deployment options single AZ (free tier), multiple AZs or with reading endpoints, for redundancy and faster access
- selection of Storage type SSD/HDD/speed
- assign VPC and group of subnets
- Encryption and backups possible
- patching by AWS, with control over major versions, costs maintenance fee
- comes with default subnet, routing should be set to connect with your active security groups or even load balancer group
- **NOT global** need read copies or CloudFront

#### Amazon Aurora

- **DB engine choice**
- managable like other RDS, **extends into managed by AWS by:**
- creation of clusters for extreme redundancy, backups, failure response in multiple AZs
- up to 5 replicas, readonly, but help with availability in another AZ
- **can be created serverless**
- reduces to access cost instead of upkeep
- adds speed
- can use AWS DMS for hetrogenous (mapping/conversion) migration
- can be used to create asyncrhonous cross-region replication (for pilot light)

#### Amazon DynmoDB

- **non-relational, non-SQL, flexible scheme DB, serverless**
- good for fast and lots of access
- tables have one key (or composite) and additional attributes
- AWS managed redundancy and availability
- controlled by write capacity units (WCUs)

#### Amazon ElastiCache

- add fast caching to other DB solutions
- must get caching orders from application

	- to request limit increase, like for vCPUs => contact AWS, adjust plan
[vpc service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/vpc-service.html)

#### AWS Well-Architected Framework

[well-architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)
- **Pillars of Best practices**
- can lookup guidelines here
**Scalability and Stabilty** - Decoupling: Messages and queues, asynchronus processing, tolerance for failed steps, absorbing spikes in demand
**Operational Excellence** - has monitory, is running, processes work
**Security** - access and permissions set as needed, never too many, has MFA
**Reliability** - workloads and availability balance works
**Performance Efficiency** - performance is fast, workload requirements (speed not size)
**Cost Optimization** - budget and plans are not exceeded, unneccessary spending avoided, think of auto-scaling (downscaling only) to reduce cost
**Sustainability** - environmental impact is minimized, downstream reduced, properly terminated unused space, SIZING workloads

## Network Scaling

- all these can be layered to **create more secure or centralized network structures**

#### Service Direct Endpoints

- **Gateway Endpoint for multiple services possible**
- do not need additional internet access
- allows subnets to talk accross VPCs, within the region
- for S3, Dynamo DB this Gateway allows regional access
- **Elastic Network Interface allows this from AZ to AZ** for many services

#### Create Endpoint

- give name
- choose type of: SDE, EC2 Instance Connect, use NLB and GWLBs, PrivateLink

#### Connect VPCs - VPC Peering

- if address ranges do NOT overlap, otherwise this will be disabled
- **ONLY in pairs (non-transitive / Edge-to-Edge)**
- then all traffic can be routed to other VPC
- accross regions

#### VPC Transit Gateway

- **multiple VPCs can be connected**
- routing config of TG controls directions
- can passthrough internet access from a single public subnet
- saves money on public IPs, only extra cost from TG
- limited to region

#### Virtual Private Gateway

- **VPN** between personal router and VPN Gateway of the VPC

#### AWS Direct Connect (DX)

- **dedicated connection** via locations between private router (on-premise) and AWS Cloud
- endpoints meet at that location

#### CDN Network - CloudFront

- **using edge locations** with closer proximity to users
- provides faster access
- restricted access groups
- global service (across all regions)
- can enforce features like HTTPS, Caching, Domain features
- uses the AWS Backbone to open Edge-to-Edge closer to request origin instead of Internet

#### Route 53 - DNS Services

- **DNS server, IP lookup for AWS cloud services**
- connects to Load Balancers
- Variants: Simple Routing, Weighted, Geolocation, Latency, Failover, Multivalue answer, IP-based, Geoproximity
- all are HTTPS, thus needs TLS certificate

#### Global Accellerator

- can **add more edge locations** to speed up access to your services
- routing to more regions
- like inter-regional load balancing

## Security
